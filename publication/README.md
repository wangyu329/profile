# Publication

Before joining industry, I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/).
My graduate research revolved around mobile computing and cyber-physical systems.
Results of my work were published in top-tier conferences and journals, such as [ACM MobiSys](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/), [ACM / IEEE IPSN](https://ipsn.acm.org/), and [IEEE TMC](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tm).
In particular, I have received the **Best Paper Award Runner-Up** at IPSN 2014.
